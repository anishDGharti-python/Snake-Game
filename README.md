# Classic Snake Game in Python

Welcome to my rendition of the classic Snake Game, implemented purely in Python using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. This project is designed to be a simple yet engaging introduction to the application of OOP techniques in game development. Whether you are new to programming or looking to understand the practical aspects of Python OOP, this game provides a fun and educational experience.

## Game Description

In this Snake Game, the player controls a snake, navigating it around the play area while avoiding walls and the snake's own tail. Each time the snake eats an apple, it grows longer, making the game increasingly challenging. The objective is to eat as many apples as possible to score higher points.

## Features

- **Pure Python Implementation**: No external libraries required, just pure Python.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Clearly structured code using classes and objects.
- **Incremental Difficulty**: The game gets more challenging as the snake grows.
- **Simple GUI**: Utilizes Python's `turtle` module for graphical output and input handling.

## Installation

No additional installation is required, provided you have Python installed on your machine. This game was developed with Python 3.8. Ensure that you are running a compatible version of Python to avoid any discrepancies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/snake-game-python-oop.git
cd snake-game-python-oop
python snake_game.py
```

## How to Play

  Use the arrow keys to change the direction of the snake.
  Avoid hitting the walls or the snake's own tail.
  Try to eat as many apples as possible to increase your score.
